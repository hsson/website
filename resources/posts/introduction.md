Hi, awesome that you found my personal website! If you were wondering about me; I think the title says it all, but if that's not enough, here is a short blurb about me:

I'm a software engineering student originating from the tall, cold country of Sweden. I'm a great technology enthusiast, especially when it comes to software, and I spend a lot of my time reading up on cool things. When I'm not studying, I try to fill up my free time with different projects — if you're curious about any of them, please have a look at my Github profile.
